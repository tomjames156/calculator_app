## Overview

This is a calculator web app built with HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript. It can perform basic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference

## My process

- I coded the layout (HTML) and added styling (CSS) simultaneously. 
- I made use of SASS to make the styles for different themes
- I added the logic using JavaScript

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS CSS preprocessor
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt about asynchronous functions which i used to make sure to get the calcuation result before displaying the result. I also made use of the try and except syntax to handle errors in case a user enters an unwanted data type.
