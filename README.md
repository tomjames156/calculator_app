## Overview

This is a calculator web app built with HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript. It can perform basic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser
